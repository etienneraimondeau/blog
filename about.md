**Who is LaPipette?**

Hi, I'm Etienne! I've always been fascinating my biology and spending too much time drawing and making posters.
In 2016, I finished my PhD in biochemistry and structural biology at EMBL (European Molecular Biology Laboratory) in Grenoble. Writing my PhD thesis and my research paper made me realise how valuable high quality science graphics are to communicate your research.  

I believe science is fun and exciting as well as beautiful.

**Why LaPipette?**

I travelled for half a year following my PhD and realised that access to education and in particular science can be difficult in some parts of the world. Unlike some people I met, I was lucky enough to be able to follow my passion and study biology. In my evenings and weekends I started personal projects by researching and illustrating recent major advances in biotechnology like novel cancer therapies or in vitro culture meat.    

I think visuals and animations are great tools to capture the audience imagination and inspire further learning.


**How does LaPipette work?**

 If youâ€™re interested in my infographics and other projects, please feel free to [contact me](/contact) so we can have a chat and see if we can work together!

**How does this website work?**

This place is powered by Jekyll and hosted on GitHub Pages. I designed this website using [Andrew Banchich Forty theme](https://github.com/andrewbanchich/forty-jekyll-theme "Forty") as a base.
