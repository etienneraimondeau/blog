**What is LaPipette?**


Hi! My name is Etienne, I am a Ph.D biochemist based in Oxford. I created LaPipette in 2018 with the help of my cat. LaPipette is a passion project that I run during nights and weekends. On LaPipette you will find illustrations and infographics about science. Most of them are about biotechnology which is my background or environment which is a very important topic to me.


**How does LaPipette works?**

I will try to publish illustrations at least once per month but sometimes I can get busy with the rest of my life. I designed this website using [Andrew Banchich Forty theme](https://github.com/andrewbanchich/forty-jekyll-theme "Forty") as a base. LaPipette is powered by Jekyll and hosted on GitHub Pages! 


**Why LaPipette?**

I travelled for few months after my PhD in biochemistry and realised that the access to education and in particular science can be difficult in some parts of the world. Unlike some people I met, I was lucky enough to be able follow my passion and study biology. 
With recent major advances in cancer therapy, gene editing and 'green tech' biotechnology promises to revolutionize our lives in the 21th century. It is important to me to explain future hopes and challenges in an accessible and fun way. Lapipette is inspired by TED, Kurzegesagt and numerous design which makes education more accessible.
