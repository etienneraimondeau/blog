### Everything you need to know about CAR-T, a revolutionary cell therapy for cancer

You might have heard of [CAR-T][1] cell^1^ therapy as a “miracle cure” for cancer. The approval of Novartis’ Kymriah, the first CAR-T therapy, made headlines in August as it was the first gene-edited cell therapy for cancer to make it to the market. The approval of Gilead and Kite Pharma’s CAR-T therapy Yescarta followed this week, leading the way for many other versions that are expected to arrive on the market in coming years to treat different types of cancer, with better efficacy and safety, and lower prices.



Companies like Juno Therapeutics, Cellectis, Celyad, Bluebird bio, and Celgene are already working on it and the number of clinical trials testing the technology is booming. In the next decade, CAR-T cells are expected to change how cancer is treated and start turning it into a much more manageable diagnosis.

But, exactly, what is CAR-T? How does it work? Can it really cure cancer? Does it have side effects? How much does it cost?

## Markdown plus h2 with a custom ID ##         {#id-goes-here}
[Link back to H2](#id-goes-here)

This is a paragraph, which is text surrounded by whitespace. Paragraphs can be on one 
line (or many), and can drone on for hours.  

Here is a Markdown link to [Warped](https://warpedvisions.org), and a literal <http://link.com/>. 
Now some SimpleLinks, like one to [google] (automagically links to are-you-
feeling-lucky), a [wiki: test] link to a Wikipedia page, and a link to 
[foldoc: CPU]s at foldoc.  

Now some inline markup like _italics_,  **bold**, and `code()`. Note that underscores in 
words are ignored in Markdown Extra.

> Blockquotes are like quoted text in email replies
>> And, they can be nested

* Bullet lists are easy too
- Another one
+ Another one

1. A numbered list
2. Which is numbered
3. With periods and a space

And now some code:

    // Code is just text indented a bit
    which(is_easy) to_remember();

~~~

// Markdown extra adds un-indented code blocks too

if (this_is_more_code == true && !indented) {
    // tild wrapped code blocks, also not indented
}

~~~

Text with  
two trailing spaces  
(on the right)  
can be used  
for things like poems  

### Horizontal rules
