		<h4>Context</h4>
		<p>More and more vaccines against COVID-19 are getting approved around the world. We have a wealth of data about these vaccines but it can be complex and confusing for the general public. Vaccines rely on different technologies to boost the immune system against the virus responsible for COVID-19 (called SARS-CoV2). Each manufacturer completed their own clinical trials to estimate the efficacy of their vaccines. I wanted to create an easy way for myself and people to reference and compare the different vaccines. The main caveat is that you cannot compare efficacy between vaccines since each clinical trial has its own standard ('end-point') to asses COVID-19 cases.</p>

#### Design
I aimed to create one very simple flashcard per vaccine taking inspiration from trading cards. Each vaccine card should have a quick reminder of the technology used and metrics about the vaccine. I wanted to colour-code each card and data for easy comparison across the stack.

#### Early version
I already had made summaries about the science behind each technology so I didn't explore many sketches. It was more about organising the information than exploring colours and visuals...

#### Final (almost) version
![Card progress](assets/images/vaccine_cards/body1-01.png)    
<br/>
Some of the data has not been published yet so the cards are not finalised and will be updated in the future. The design is however final and features 8 cards. Each vaccine technology has its own colour. The final design is tailored for smartphone screens to promote accessibility as much as possible.

Two versions are available in english listing efficacies vs disease severity or vs variants. Only the cards with the efficacy against variants are available in multiple languages. Please note that these were translated over few months ago now so the data could be outdated (sorry! I'll try to fix this)
