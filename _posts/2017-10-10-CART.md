#### CAR-T, a revolutionary cell therapy for cancer has been recently approved by the FDA. But what is it about?

The idea of immunotherapy or using our own immune system against cancer has been around for more than 60 years. At that time, the absence of technique for culturing and manipulating cells made it impossible to harness the power of the immune cells. Decades later, scientists were able to design and produce antibodies targetting specific molecules on the surface of cancer cells. Such terapies were only approved for patients in the late 90s. 

A more radical approach has been allowed recently by the discovery of genome editing enzymes such as TALENs and the famours CRISPR proteins. Lymphocytes are the specialised soldiers in the immune system army. In particular, Lymphocytes T (T cells) are able to find and kill enemy cells as well as coordinate attacks by the other immune cells. They thus constitute a perfect candidate for scientists to engineer an immune response against cancer. Antigen receptors are 'molecular scanners' at the surface of the T cells enabling the detection of abnomal cells. These can be modified via genome editing to force T cells to bind and destroy cancer cells. This new generation of immunotherapies has been showing incredible positive results during clinical trials which led to the approval of the first CAR-T.

**Let's explore what CAR-T are, how we make them: and why this is an exciting new way to fight cancer:**
